    你好，世界！
除夕的钟声敲响时，全家围坐在圆桌旁，蒸汽从青花瓷碗中袅袅升起。奶奶将包着硬币的饺子悄悄放进我的碗里，笑着说：“吃到的人新年会有好运！”窗外鞭炮声震耳欲聋，红色纸屑如雨纷飞，父亲用竹竿挑起一串千响爆竹，火光在夜幕中划出金色弧线。午夜过后，我摸着口袋里的压岁红包，枕着新衣沉沉睡去，梦里尽是糖果与灯笼汇成的河流。
春节的魔力在于它让漂泊的归心似箭，让平凡的餐桌化作温暖的图腾。十五天后，元宵的甜糯还未消散，门楣上的春联已微微卷边，但那份团圆的暖意早已渗入砖瓦，成为中国人心中不灭的灯火。
At dawn, I followed a murmuring creek into the emerald valley. Moss-clad rocks glistened under the canopy, where sunbeams pierced through leaves like golden threads. A kingfisher darted across the water, its turquoise wings cutting the mist in a flash of brilliance. I knelt by the stream, cupping icy water to my face – the shock of clarity echoed through my bones.
Further along the trail, an abandoned wooden bridge arched over the current. Its weathered planks creaked a timeless song under my steps, telling tales of forgotten travelers. As twilight painted the peaks violet, fireflies emerged to dance above ferns, their bioluminescent sparks mirroring the emerging stars. In that moment, the mountain breathed with me, ancient yet eternally new.
Nature’s poetry needs no translation; it etches itself directly onto the soul.
